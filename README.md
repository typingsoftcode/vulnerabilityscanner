# Vulnerability Scanner using Nmap

## Overview

This repository contains an advanced Nmap-based vulnerability scanning script designed for security professionals and system administrators.
The script provides a user-friendly interface for conducting various types of network scans, analyzing results, and generating comprehensive reports.

## Features

- Multiple scan types (Quick, Full, Vulnerability)
- Flexible output formats (Normal, XML, JSON)
- Real-time progress indicator
- Detailed result analysis and recommendations
- HTML report generation
- Comprehensive logging system
- Enhanced error handling and security checks

## Technical Stack

- Bash scripting
- Nmap (Network Mapper)
- JSON processing (jq)
- HTML report generation

## Implementation Details

### Scan Types

1. **Quick Scan (-F)**: Rapid scan of the most common 100 ports
2. **Full Scan (-p-)**: Comprehensive scan of all 65535 ports
3. **Vulnerability Scan (-sV -sC --script vuln)**: Detailed scan with version detection and vulnerability scripts

### Output Formats

1. **Normal**: Standard Nmap output
2. **XML**: Structured output for programmatic parsing
3. **JSON**: Machine-readable format for easy integration with other tools

### Code Architecture

The script follows a modular design with separate functions for each major functionality:

- Input validation
- Scan type and output format selection
- Progress indication
- Result parsing and analysis
- Report generation

This structure enhances readability, maintainability, and extensibility of the code.

## Security Considerations

1. **Root Privilege Check**: Ensures the script runs with necessary permissions
2. **Input Validation**: Prevents command injection by validating IP addresses and CIDR notation
3. **Secure File Handling**: Sets appropriate permissions (600) for output files
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and logging
5. **HTML Escaping**: Prevents XSS vulnerabilities in HTML reports
6. **Responsible Usage Warning**: Reminds users to obtain proper authorization before scanning

## Usage

1. Clone the repository using git clone
2. Navigate to the directory using cd
3. Make the script executable by using chmod +x
4. Run the script with sudo and ./
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to select scan type and output format

## Dependencies

- Nmap: `sudo apt-get install nmap`
- jq (optional, for better JSON parsing): `sudo apt-get install jq`
